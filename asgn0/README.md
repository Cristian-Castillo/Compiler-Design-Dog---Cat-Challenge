--------
## Requirements üíª
The following installations are required to execute code:
- Ubuntu 18.04 environment

- Virtual Machine 

- Clang

## Assignment 0 Directory Contents üìÇ
- dog.cpp: is the main driver program

- dog_definition.cpp: Contains function definitions and operations

- dog_header.h: Contains declared void functions that work with dog_definitions to enable driver program

- DesignDocument.pdf: Contains Design plan, pseudo code (each part), Test Case, functions, assignment solution, assumption, goals, and data structures

- Makefile: Runs and compiles the necessary flags for the program and initiates a ready state for the program to be executed.

- README.me: What you are currently reading; Contains concise specs about program information and setup.

## Notes üìù
- This program was developed on a virtual machine environment with Ubuntu and replicates the linux cat command via system calls to the Kernel's Operating System.

- Folders are not accepted arguments, but the robustness tolerates such inputs and informs the user of bad arguments maintaining a safety of margin.

- Testing can be done by typing in terminal type: valgrind ./dog. See Design Documentation for infinite loops and more details. To continue test in valgrind press ctrl+d, should the test come to a pause.

- Terminal format input: ./dog argument1 argument2 argument3 

## Limitations/Issues ‚ùó
- Dog.cpp runs properly only on Unix files and environment.

- Caveat! Only one dash argument is allowed for this program dog.cpp, additional dashes will be ignored.

- If the command ./dog has no file arguments it will prompt the user to enter data until ctrl+d is entered.

- If the user provides ./dog foo.txt foo2, the content within the those files will be printed in the order that the arguments were received.

- If the user provides ./dog fooDir, the terminal will notify the user of an invalid argument.

- If the user provides ./dog - with no arguments it will prompt the user to enter data until ctrl+d is entered.

- If the user provides ./dog - - or ./dog -- additional dashes will be ignored.

- If the user provides ./dog - foo.txt foo fooDIRECTORY -, dash will prompt the user for data, output the data via the terminal continuously, read the sequential file arguments (outputting the pertained content to those files), and notify that a directory is not allowed as an argument via the terminal's output. Lastly, ignoring the final dash.

## Instructions ü§ñ
- From desktop cd into asgn0 directory

- Once in asgn0 directory, type in make. The Makefile will run and compile the necessary flags for the program and initiate a ready state for the program to be executed.

- Optional: the user can create a directory or files with content to test program. Ensure the files contain content, also optional.

- in terminal input: ./dog (following optional arguments)
